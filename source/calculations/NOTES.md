According to Kubackza (2014), to compute the component of the termodinamyc factor matrix in generalized maxwell stepah nequations, as follows: 

$$
\Gamma_{ik} = \delta_{ik}+x_{i}\left(\frac{\partial \ln \gamma_i}{\partial x_k} - \frac{\partial \ln \gamma_i}{\partial x_m} \right) \quad i,k = 1,2,...,m-1
$$

Because the thermodyncamic models, like UNIFAC, are composed of many terms and parameters, models difficult to differentiate. For this purpose we employ finite difference method to approximate it value. 

The function lnActivityCoefficient() returns vector with the natural logaritmh of each compound. Where the membrane is the last term. To
