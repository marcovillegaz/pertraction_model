# maxwellStefan/mutualDifussion.m 
This correpsond to maxwel'stefans diffusion coeffcients

# maxwellStefan/thermodynamicsFactors.m 
compute the thermodinamyc factor matrix $[\Gamma]$ from maxwell-stefan. The function used the activityCoefficient.m (LINK) function to obtian the activity coeffcient $\gamma$ using various models. 

The equation to compute this matrix is the one presented in 

*FORMULA GOES HERE*

Depending on the unifac model used, you should enter ad input the polymerization degree, for example in UNIFAC-FV model- 


# maxwellStefan/inverseDrag.m
compute the inverstrag coeffcient matrix $[B]$ based on the mutual diffusion coeffcients, also known as Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients.
